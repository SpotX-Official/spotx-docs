# Where can I find SpotX for Android/iOS/Linux/macOS?

We only support desktop versions for [Windows](https://github.com/amd64fox/SpotX), [Mac, and Linux](https://github.com/jetfir3/SpotX-Bash), but you can find third-party developments for android like [xManager](https://github.com/xManager-App/xManager/) and for iOS like [Spotilife](https://julio.hackyouriphone.org/).
