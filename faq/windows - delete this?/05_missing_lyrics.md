# Why can`t I find lyrics?

In the new theme, lyrics have been moved to the right sidebar. If you want to revert to the old lyrics for the new theme, use the parameter [**-old_lyrics**](https://github.com/amd64fox/SpotX/discussions/60) during the SpotX installation or install the old theme.\
Also, don't forget that now you can find lyrics by switching to [fullscreen mode](https://github.com/amd64fox/SpotX/discussions/50#discussioncomment-3722941).

:::warning

**Important** 

Spotify (Musixmatch) can remove or add lyrics for songs at any time, spotx has no effect on this
