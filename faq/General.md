### My region is South Korea and the mod doesn`t work for me, why?

South Korea is the only region that does not offer a free Spotify tier, the mod will not work in that region unless using a premium subscription.

### Can I use SpotX and Spicetify together?

Clean install looks like this :

- install SpotX
- install Spicetify (tweak it to your liking)


Important ‼️
I do not recommend using them together, only do so if you have a valid reason for doing so.

### Can Spotify ban my account for using SpotX?

In practice, I do not know of a single case of an account being banned for using a mod. An important rule, if you are chatting with Spotify support and are asked questions about using third-party software, etc., always answer no. If you, yourself, admit to using the mod then you will probably get your account banned.

### My antivirus found a threat in SpotX, should I be worried about my security?

SpotX is completely secure, this is a false positive. At the moment, most modern antiviruses use artificial intelligence to identify new threats and sometimes it does not work quite correctly, sometimes it takes time to fix this false positive. You can simply add the offending files to your antivirus exclusion list or temporarily disable your protection.

I use completely open source code written mostly in PowerShell. Feel free to review the code in its entirety in the SpotX repo and if you find anything odd, ask me about the specific code in question.

questions like: my antivirus swears at SpotX are not accepted and will be ignored.

### Does Discord Listen Along work?
To invite friends to listen, they'll need to have Spotify Premium or they'll

receive an error!
or use plugins for modified discord client

### I get ads when I use Spotify Connect, Airplay etc. Why?

Ads are blocked only in the desktop application, if you redirect the audio stream to another device using Spotify Connect, Airplay or something like that, ads may appear on some devices because the audio stream is no longer coming from the desktop application.

### Why block Spotify automatic updates?

The official Spotify is automatically updated about once or twice a month, if this happens then SpotX will be lost to you as the official Spotify installer will simply overwrite it, and you will need to reinstall it.

If you block updates while installing SpotX, it will continue to work until you uninstall it yourself.

It is recommended to block updates so that SpotX works as long as possible for you.

### Why can`t I find lyrics?

In the new theme, lyrics have been moved to the right sidebar. Also, don't forget that now you can find lyrics by switching to fullscreen mode.

Important ‼️
Spotify (Musixmatch) can remove or add lyrics for songs at any time, spotx has no effect on this

### Do you have pre-patched Spotify builds?

Yes, you can find them in the telegram community.

### What premium features does SpotX not provide?

Primarily, this encompasses all the features handled on the server side, such as: exceptionally high sound quality, track downloads, AI DJ, group sessions, and jam.
